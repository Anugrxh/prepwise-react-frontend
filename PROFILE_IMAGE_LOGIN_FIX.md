# Profile Image Login Fix

## Problem
Profile image was not appearing immediately after fresh login. Users had to refresh the page to see their profile image in the navbar.

## Root Cause
The login API response only contained basic user information (name, email, id) but didn't include the complete user profile with the `profileImage` field. The AuthContext was setting the user state with incomplete data.

## Solution Applied

### Updated Login Function (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)

**Before:**
```javascript
const login = async (credentials) => {
  // ... login logic
  const { user: userData, token } = response.data.data;
  setUser(userData); // Only basic user data from login response
  // ...
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const login = async (credentials) => {
  // ... login logic
  const { user: userData, token } = response.data.data;
  setUser(userData); // Set initial user data
  
  // Fetch fresh user data to ensure we have the complete profile including image
  try {
    const freshUserResponse = await authAPI.getCurrentUser();
    if (freshUserResponse.data.success) {
      const freshUserData = freshUserResponse.data.data.user;
      setUser(freshUserData); // Update with complete profile data
      localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(freshUserData));
    }
  } catch (fetchError) {
    console.warn("Failed to fetch fresh user data after login:", fetchError);
    // Continue with the login data we already have
  }
  // ...
};
```

### Updated Register Function
Applied the same fix to the register function to ensure new users also get their complete profile data immediately.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Login**: User logs in with credentials
2. **Basic User Data**: Login API returns basic user info + token
3. **Set Initial State**: AuthContext sets user state with basic data
4. **Fetch Complete Profile**: Makes additional API call to `/api/auth/me` to get complete user profile
5. **Update State**: Updates user state with complete profile including `profileImage`
6. **Immediate Display**: Navbar now has access to profile image immediately

## Error Handling

- If the fresh user data fetch fails, the login still succeeds
- User gets a console warning but continues with basic user data
- Graceful degradation ensures login process isn't broken

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Fresh Login:
- ✅ User logs in successfully
- ✅ Profile image appears immediately in navbar
- ✅ No page refresh required
- ✅ Complete user profile data available immediately

### Registration:
- ✅ User registers successfully
- ✅ Profile image (if any) appears immediately
- ✅ Complete user profile data available immediately

## Files Modified

1. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`**:
   - Updated `login()` function to fetch fresh user data after login
   - Updated `register()` function to fetch fresh user data after registration
   - Added error handling for fresh data fetch

## API Calls Flow

### Before:
```
Login → Set user state → Profile image missing
```

### After:
```
Login → Set basic user state → Fetch complete profile → Update user state → Profile image visible
```

The fix ensures that users see their complete profile information, including profile images, immediately after login without requiring a page refresh.
