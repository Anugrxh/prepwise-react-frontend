# Cache Invalidation Fix

## Problem
After updating data (profile image, completing interviews, creating new interviews), the changes only appeared after a manual page refresh. This was because the cached data wasn't being invalidated when the underlying data changed.

## Root Cause
The caching system was working correctly, but we weren't invalidating the cache when data was modified. This meant:
- Profile image updates weren't reflected immediately
- New interview counts weren't updated on dashboard
- Completed interviews didn't show updated status
- Analytics data remained stale

## Solution Applied

### 1. Profile Page (`src/pages/Profile.jsx`)
**Added cache invalidation to:**
- **Profile image upload**: `handleImageUpload()` function
- **Profile update**: `handleProfileUpdate()` function

```javascript
// Added to both functions after successful API calls
invalidateAllData(); // Clears all cached data to ensure fresh reload
```

### 2. Interview Page (`src/pages/Interview.jsx`)
**Added cache invalidation to:**
- **Interview completion**: After `completeInterview()` is called

```javascript
// After successful interview completion
invalidateInterviewData(); // Clears interview-related cache
invalidateAnalyticsData(); // Clears analytics cache (for updated scores)
```

### 3. Interview Setup Page (`src/pages/InterviewSetup.jsx`)
**Added cache invalidation to:**
- **Interview generation**: After `generateInterview()` is called

```javascript
// After successful interview generation
invalidateInterviewData(); // Clears interview cache to show new interview
```

### 4. Interview History Component (`src/components/InterviewHistory.jsx`)
**Already had cache invalidation for:**
- **Interview deletion**: `handleDeleteInterview()` function ✅

## Cache Invalidation Strategy

### Granular Invalidation:
- **`invalidateInterviewData()`**: Clears interview-related cache (interviews, stats, counts)
- **`invalidateAnalyticsData()`**: Clears analytics/performance cache
- **`invalidateAllData()`**: Clears all cached data (used for profile changes)

### When Each is Used:
- **Profile changes**: `invalidateAllData()` - Profile affects multiple areas
- **Interview completion**: Both interview and analytics data - affects counts and scores
- **Interview creation**: `invalidateInterviewData()` - affects interview lists and counts
- **Interview deletion**: `invalidateInterviewData()` - affects interview lists and counts

## Files Modified

1. **`src/pages/Profile.jsx`**:
   - Added `invalidateAllData` import
   - Added cache invalidation to `handleImageUpload()`
   - Added cache invalidation to `handleProfileUpdate()`

2. **`src/pages/Interview.jsx`**:
   - Added `useData` import
   - Added `invalidateInterviewData, invalidateAnalyticsData` imports
   - Added cache invalidation after interview completion

3. **`src/pages/InterviewSetup.jsx`**:
   - Added `useData` import
   - Added `invalidateInterviewData` import
   - Added cache invalidation after interview generation

4. **`src/components/InterviewHistory.jsx`**:
   - Already had proper cache invalidation ✅

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Profile Updates:
- ✅ Profile image changes appear immediately
- ✅ Profile name changes appear immediately
- ✅ No need to refresh page

### Interview Operations:
- ✅ New interviews appear in dashboard immediately
- ✅ Interview counts update immediately
- ✅ Completed interviews show updated status immediately
- ✅ Analytics scores update immediately
- ✅ Dashboard stats reflect changes immediately

### Cache Performance:
- ✅ Cache still provides performance benefits
- ✅ Only invalidates when data actually changes
- ✅ Fresh data loads automatically after mutations
- ✅ No unnecessary API calls for unchanged data

## Testing Checklist

1. **Profile Image Update**:
   - [ ] Upload new profile image
   - [ ] Image should appear immediately without refresh
   - [ ] Image should appear in navbar immediately

2. **Interview Creation**:
   - [ ] Create new interview
   - [ ] Dashboard should show updated interview count immediately
   - [ ] New interview should appear in recent interviews list

3. **Interview Completion**:
   - [ ] Complete an interview
   - [ ] Dashboard should show updated completed count immediately
   - [ ] Analytics should show updated scores immediately
   - [ ] Interview status should update immediately

4. **Profile Name Update**:
   - [ ] Update profile name
   - [ ] Name should appear immediately in navbar
   - [ ] Name should appear immediately in dashboard welcome message

The cache invalidation ensures that users see their changes immediately while still benefiting from the performance improvements of caching for unchanged data.
