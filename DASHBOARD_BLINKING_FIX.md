# Dashboard Blinking Fix

## Problem Identified
The Dashboard was stuck in an infinite loop causing constant re-rendering and API calls, resulting in a "blinking" effect.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a circular dependency in the useEffect and useDebouncedCallback:

1. `debouncedLoadData` was created with `currentPage` in its dependency array
2. `useEffect` depended on `debouncedLoadData`
3. Every time `debouncedLoadData` was recreated, it triggered the useEffect
4. This caused `loadDashboardData` to be called repeatedly

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Debounced Callback
**Before:**
```javascript
const debouncedLoadData = useDebouncedCallback(
  async (page, forceRefresh = false) => {
    await loadDashboardData(page, forceRefresh);
  },
  300,
  [currentPage] // This was causing the circular dependency
);

useEffect(() => {
  debouncedLoadData(currentPage);
}, [currentPage, debouncedLoadData]); // This created the loop
```

**After:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    loadDashboardData(currentPage);
  }, 300);

  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [currentPage, loadDashboardData]);
```

### 2. Added Loading State Protection
Added a flag to prevent multiple simultaneous API calls:

```javascript
const [isLoadingData, setIsLoadingData] = useState(false);

const loadDashboardData = useCallback(async (page = 1, forceRefresh = false) => {
  // Prevent multiple simultaneous loads
  if (isLoadingData) {
    console.log('[Dashboard] Already loading, skipping...');
    return;
  }

  try {
    setIsLoadingData(true);
    // ... rest of the function
  } finally {
    setLoadingStats(false);
    setIsLoadingData(false);
  }
}, [fetchDashboardData, interviewsPerPage, isLoadingData]);
```

### 3. Cleaned Up Imports
Removed unused imports:
- `useDebouncedCallback` (no longer needed)
- `useMemo` (not used)
- `React` (not needed with modern React)
- `getDebugInfo` (not used in this component)

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Fixed infinite loop and added loading protection

## Result
- ✅ Dashboard no longer blinks or re-renders constantly
- ✅ API calls are properly debounced (300ms)
- ✅ Loading states work correctly
- ✅ Cache hits are working as expected
- ✅ No more infinite loops in console logs

## Console Output After Fix
Instead of hundreds of repeated logs, you should now see:
```
[Dashboard] Loading data for page 1, forceRefresh: false
[API Cache] Hit: interviews-page-1-limit-5
[API Cache] Hit: analytics-performance
[API Cache] Hit: interview-stats-overview
[Dashboard] Data loaded successfully
```

The fix maintains all the optimization benefits while eliminating the problematic infinite loop.
